Feb 2020, Pleuni Pennings

The original data for this project are on Illumina BaseSpace, shared with me by Christopher Kline (U Pittsburgh). 

I also have a copy of the original FastQ files on my harddrive called "Pleuni Backup". 

There are 3 xlsx files that tell us which sample comes from which monkey. They are stored on the harddrive called "Pleuni Backup" and also in the R project location /Users/pleunipennings/Documents/Git/R21_Macaques_Mac251/Data/OriginalSampleFiles
